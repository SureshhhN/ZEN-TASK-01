                                                                                                                     HTTP -- HYPERTEXT TRANSPORT PROTOCOL


                               HTTP1.1                                                                                                                                                                                              HTTP2

    *Persistant Connections Request Queuing.                                                                                                                           *Multiplexing over Single Connection.
   
    *It works on the textual format.                                                                                                                                              *It works on the binary protocol.

    *HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection .                                                                                                *HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1.                    
    
    *It compresses data by itself.                                                                                                                                                    *It uses HPACK for data compression.
    
                                                          
                                                                                                    2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript:

     In this blog post, i explain:
     
         *Object
         *Objects Internal representation in Js
  

         #Object:-

                              Objects in programming can be a combination of "variables, functions, and data structures". They make code more readable. Object  properties can be both primitive                 values,  other objects, and functions. 



         #Objects Internal representation in Js:-

                              Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s                               primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending                                on their types).

                              eg:                                          let candidate = {
                                                                                 
                                                                                   First name : Suresh
                                                                                    Last name : N
                                                                                                 age : 21
                                                                                         Address : xyz address

                                                                                };

                                                                 console.log(candidate.First name);   //Output:  Suresh
                                                                 console.log(candidate.age);                 //21
